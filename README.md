# Vue.js Feature Demo App 🚀

This project is a simple Vue 3 application built to demonstrate core Composition API features. It's intended for an in-class tutorial and includes individual components that each showcase one Vue concept in an interactive way.

## 🧩 Features Demonstrated

Each component in this app highlights a different Vue feature:

| Component           | Feature                                                        |
| ------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `RefBtn.vue`        | `ref()` – Reactive primitives                                  |
| `ReactiveBtn.vue`   | `reactive()` – Reactive objects                                |
| `ComputedBtn.vue`   | `computed()` – Derived state                                   |
| `VIfElseBtn.vue`    | `v-if / v-else` – Conditional rendering with dropdown & images |
| `ListRenderBtn.vue` | `v-for` – List rendering with a reactive array                 |
| `ListRenderBtn.vue` | `v-model` – Bind form input with reactive data                 |

All components are imported and rendered in `App.vue` using Bootstrap cards for layout and clarity.
